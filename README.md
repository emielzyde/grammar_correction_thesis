# Addressing the data sparsity bottleneck for grammatical error detection #

This repository contains the code for my thesis 'Addressing the data sparsity bottleneck for grammatical error detection'. 

This repository contains forks of several other repositories, including:
  1. seq2seq - an encoder-decoder framework used for machine translation (https://github.com/marekrei/sequence-labeler)
  2. sequence-labeler - a grammatical error detection model (https://github.com/google/seq2seq/)
  3. RelGAN - a GAN for text generation (https://github.com/weilinie/RelGAN)
All licences, terms and conditions from these repositories apply. 

Changes have been made to the code in these repositories. A detailed list of the changes implemented can be found in the modifications.txt file. This file covers all of the major code changes which were made.
