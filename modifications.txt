helper.py (in seq2seq - contrib - seq2seq) 
	Added in annealed temperature sampling to ‘sample’ function

utils_new.py (in wronging - utils)
	Added in a bunch of intermediate metrics (e.g. GLEU, average # of incorrect tokens, etc…)
	Added in ability to specify the desired percentage of erorrs (rather than just the min and max number) 

beam_search.py (in wronging - seq2seq - seq2seq - inference)
	Modified the ‘hyp.score’ function to add all of the noising schemes from the Xie et al. paper (from Stanford), namely random, rank and top noising
	Hyperparameters will have to be tuned for this
